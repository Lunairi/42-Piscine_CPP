# 42-Piscine_CPP
My piscine CPP work at 42. The piscine is a 2 week crash course on C++ that the first week focuses on object oriented programming, while the second week focuses on more C++ specific stuff. I managed to pass everday and only failed to finish 5 assignments total from every day combined. I was able to complete both rush challenges (more info in the respective rush folders, and they each have their own repo).

- Rush00 Ft_Retro - Space Invaders : https://github.com/Lunairi/42-Ft_Retro
- Rush01 Ft_Gkrellm - System Monitoring : https://github.com/Lunairi/42-Ft_Gkrellm

This repo contains my work and progress through each day, below shows what I've done and the grade I earned for that day. (Even if I completed 100% of the assignments some days I did misread some instructions or some instructions weren't as clear, but regardless the practice and knowledge gained is invaluable).
To pass a day you must at least accomplish 50/100.

Progress and results:
- Day00  |  3/3   |  (100%)
- Day01  |  11/11 |  (86%)
- Day02  |  3/4   |  (76%)
- Day03  |  5/5   |  (100%)
- Day04  |  3/5   |  (60%)
