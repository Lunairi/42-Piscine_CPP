 # Ft_Gkrellm: System Monitoring Tool
 
 __42 PISCINE-CPP RUSH 01 PROJECT__
 
 A project that we are given a time limit of 53 hours, 42 minutes to write and implement a simple gkrellm tool.
 We were given instructions to use ncurses to make this monitoring tools as well as provided freedom to add any modules that we find necessary. We had to make two styles of Gkrellm, one with a graphic gui while the other in a basic ncurses. We used SFML our gui.

 This repo has SFML for the graphic library. To run this, use 'make sfml' and it will echo you a command you must run in the terminal.
 Other necessary files and stuff are included as well.
  
 This project was part of a weekend rush challenge from the CPP Piscine at 42. This is the second and final rush challenge.
