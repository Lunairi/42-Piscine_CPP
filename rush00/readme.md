# Space Invaders

__42 PISCINE-CPP RUSH 00__

A project that we are given a time limit of 53 hours, 42 minutes to write and complete a full retro arcade game in C++.
The project focuses on old school space invader but with a twist. The game difficulty has been amped to simulate more of a bullet hell style game.
Players will be able to engross themselves in a difficult yet fun experience of space invaders with a twist.
