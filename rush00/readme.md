 # Ft_Retro: Space Invaders
 
 __42 PISCINE-CPP RUSH 00 PROJECT__
 
 A project that we are given a time limit of 53 hours, 42 minutes to write and complete a full retro arcade game in C++.
 We were given instructions to use ncurses to make this game interactive in the terminal.
  The project focuses on old school space invader but with a twist. The game difficulty has been amped to simulate more of a bullet hell style game.
  Players will be able to engross themselves in a difficult yet fun experience of space invaders with a twist.
  
 This project was part of a weekend rush challenge from the CPP Piscine at 42. You can see my CPP Piscine work here: https://github.com/Lunairi/42-Piscine_CPP
